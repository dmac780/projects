<h1>DMAC780 JavaScript Project Blog</h1>

<p>This is a personal project blog for showcasing JavaScript/Content projects I've been working on.</p>

<p>Built with HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript, the blog includes:</p>
<ul>

<li>Most of my personal JS projects from 2024 onwards</li>

<li>Ambient background music and custom sound effects to create atmosphere</li>

<li>CSS animations</li>

<li>Select writing and thoughts</li>
</ul>
<p>It's designed to highlight my personal frontend and JavaScript work, especially since most of my portfolio is backend-focused or not publicly viewable.</p>

<p>Thanks for checking it out.</p>
